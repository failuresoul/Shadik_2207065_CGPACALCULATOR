This is my first project of Java.At first i make home page and give a background image as well as add some text to say about my calculator.Then after clicking the calculate cgpa button,it will go to the next page
where we can give input such as course code,credit,teacher and grade.I made 3 functionalites,when i press add then if required field are filled then it will push it.When i want to delete a selected row,just select it 
and press delete.If i press reset,then everything will reset.When i add something,i make a table where it will push.At first i give a maximum credit.When this limit cross,it won't take anything.Same to that when it is
below the required,then it will not calculate.After equating required+what i give,it will give the result.In the final page,i show it and additionally i represent the full details of my courses.At the end,if i want i 
go to the again home page.
